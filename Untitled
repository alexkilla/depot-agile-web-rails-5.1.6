  How to not let your teammates powerless and in desperation: write tests.

  TESTIN NOTES
  //avoid using anyTimes() in your mocks, it does not verify anything.
  //write methods returning something not just void modify(someObject, passedValuesUsedInside)
  //verify your mocks if no then is no use.
  //write partial mocks to test method that have internal method calls
  //test>encapsulation
  //test first if possible (know as TDD)
  //dont test internal method calls inside another method test.
  //if all preparation for test seems too much, you are doing too much in that unit.
